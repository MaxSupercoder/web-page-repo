I made a 'Technical Skills' part in the home tab, and lots of other little adjustments which include:

-Cursors

-Back button for about tab

-Website Logo

-Wrote paragraphs for the first two about Tabs

-I fixed the bug where "if you tried to cycle through the abouts tabs a second time it wouldnt work properly"
