<p style="font-family:Gothic; font-size: larger; border-left: 15px; margin: 10px;">Mesopotamia's soil was uniquely fertile, this gave the people reason to settle in the land. The reason why the soil in Mesopotamia was so fertile; was because the rivers deposited minerals that made the soil good for crops. The rivers would 
  <a href="indexx.html" style="color: rgb(117, 154, 255);">flood every summer</a> destroying their crops, so they built large cannals 
diverting the water around their farmland to have a close source of fresh water for their crops and other needs. As the city grew larger and different
settlements were made, more trenches and cannals were aslo made, and more of the river's water was diverted into the cities changing the water
flow. Although the river's water supply was always replenishing, the constant drain of water through the cities
was causing it to decrease. As the rivers water flow was changing due to its water being diverted into the cities; the amounts(and destination)

Every year the Tigris and Euphrates rivers <a href="indexx.html" style="color: rgb(117, 154, 255);">would flood</a> and they deposited <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sediment+in+mesopotamia&rlz=1C1AVNG_enAU634AU634&sxsrf=ALiCzsZU-f4EpnBF0FQ1JKjTzMb_9arvuw%3A1655942554592&ei=mq2zYpLmI_nY4-EPhJKcoAU&oq=sediment+in+meso&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdOgcIABBHELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgQIABBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgUIABCABDoFCAAQkQI6BggAEB4QFjoICAAQHhAPEBY6CAgAEB4QFhAKSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUMkFWJ82YKZHaAFwAXgAgAHYAYgBkgqSAQUwLjcuMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz" style="color: rgb(0, 65, 0);">sediment</a>.
 Although because of the river's water flow being diverted by the people, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sediment+in+mesopotamia&rlz=1C1AVNG_enAU634AU634&sxsrf=ALiCzsZU-f4EpnBF0FQ1JKjTzMb_9arvuw%3A1655942554592&ei=mq2zYpLmI_nY4-EPhJKcoAU&oq=sediment+in+meso&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdOgcIABBHELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgQIABBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgUIABCABDoFCAAQkQI6BggAEB4QFjoICAAQHhAPEBY6CAgAEB4QFhAKSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUMkFWJ82YKZHaAFwAXgAgAHYAYgBkgqSAQUwLjcuMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz" style="color: rgb(0, 65, 0);">sediment</a> 
 was being deposited lower down(not in the soil).

 then could have built up in the rivers, while the people in the cities have no fertile crops, and since the rivers would flood regularly; the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sediment+in+mesopotamia&rlz=1C1AVNG_enAU634AU634&sxsrf=ALiCzsZU-f4EpnBF0FQ1JKjTzMb_9arvuw%3A1655942554592&ei=mq2zYpLmI_nY4-EPhJKcoAU&oq=sediment+in+meso&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdMgoIIRAeEA8QFhAdOgcIABBHELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgQIABBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgUIABCABDoFCAAQkQI6BggAEB4QFjoICAAQHhAPEBY6CAgAEB4QFhAKSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUMkFWJ82YKZHaAFwAXgAgAHYAYgBkgqSAQUwLjcuMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz" style="color: rgb(0, 65, 0);">sediment</a>
 would continuously fill the rivers.

 filling could play a part in the changing coastline. Another reason for Mesopotamia's changing coastline could be the immense 
 droughts that resulted from; the Mesopotamians diverting all the water away from the rivers. The droughts could have caused the water
  levels to drop drastically and cause the coastline to receed.

<h2 style="font-family:Gothic; font-size: 25px; border-left: 15px; margin: 10px;">How Would The Changing Coastline Have Affected The People?</h2>
<p style="font-family:Gothic; font-size: larger; border-left: 15px; margin: 10px;">
The increased population that Mesopotamia's fertile land has gathered, put pressure on the lands remaing resources, especially the soil. Since the diversion of waters caused the sediment deposits to change, 


the soil was not replenishing itself quick enough. <a href="indexx.html" style="color: rgb(117, 154, 255);">(click to learn more about the floods)</a>
Without the fertile soil, the crops were not growing as well, and the people had to work harder to maintain their crops. This meant that the people would not have as much food. 

<br>
<br>
There were also harsh droughts on Mesopotamia, and the people did not have enough clean water because of this. The lack of clean water meant that 
the people had to work even harder, and the droughts would've aslo decreased the amount of water in the rivers, which meant the amounts sediment carried by the rivers probably would decrease as well. This meant that the crops would suffer even more, as well as the water depletion.
Lack of food and water caused Mesopotamia, a once thriving land, to become almost unlivable, and because of this 
there where mass migrations. People left the stricken areas and went to more abundant areas. Consequently, the adandonded land began to gather dust and sand from the neighbour desert regions, as a result the dust built up over years leaving the cities in buried ruins.
